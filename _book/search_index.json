[["index.html", "A Minimal Book Example Chapter 1 Prerequisites", " A Minimal Book Example Yihui Xie 2020-11-13 Chapter 1 Prerequisites This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). For now, you have to install the development versions of bookdown from Github: devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 5), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

"],["final-words.html", "Chapter 6 Final Words", " Chapter 6 Final Words We have finished a nice book. "],["mods.html", "Chapter 7 Modifications", " Chapter 7 Modifications Ben Marwick In this template book, I have made some modifications inspired by Matthew Salganik’s Open Review Toolkit. The ORT is an excellent project to enable low-friction engagement between the author and readers. However, it pre-dates bookdown and lacks some of its flexibility, so this is an effort to bring some of the features of the ORT into bookdown. I’ve made three modifications: an open review block, a call-to-action block, and added google analytics. 7.0.1 Open review block This is a custom block that is appearing at the top of each page informing the reader that they can give immediate feedback directly on the page. The HTML for this block is in open_review_block.html The feedback tool is hypothes.is, which enables sentence-level annotation directly on the page. There is a script in hypothesis.html, which we call in _output.yml like this: bookdown::gitbook: includes: in_header: [hypothesis.html, google_analytics.html] before_body: open_review_block.html after_body: call_to_action_block.html css: style.css The hypothesis.html file contains a short script that activates the tool on this site. It also enables us to use the icons in the block above. The ORT also had code to track the use of hypothes.is, but I don’t understand how that works, so I haven’t done it here. There are also additions to style.css to add a little styling to one of the inline images in the custom block (named rmdreview), and adds the speech bubbles on the left side of the block: .h-icon-chevron-left { background: white; padding: 3px; border: #eee 1px solid; color: #666; } .fa-rotate-315 { -webkit-transform: rotate(315deg); -moz-transform: rotate(315deg); -ms-transform: rotate(315deg); -o-transform: rotate(315deg); transform: rotate(315deg); } .rmdreview { padding: 1em 1em 1em 5em; margin-bottom: 0px; background: #f5f5f5 5px center/3em no-repeat; position:relative; } .rmdreview:before { content: &quot;\\f0e6&quot;; font-family: FontAwesome; left:10px; position:absolute; top:10px; bottom: 0px; font-size: 60px; } 7.0.2 Call-to-action block The call-to-action block appears at the bottom of each page to invite the reader to submit their email address to receive updates on the book. This enables us to collect email addresses into a google sheet. The custom block looks like this: This custom block is called rmdsale, the html for it is stored in all_to_action_block.html, which we refer to in the _output.yml file, as above. The call-to-action block is styled with some css: .rmdsale { padding: 1em 1em 1em 4em; margin-bottom: 0px; background: #f5f5f5 5px center/3em no-repeat; position:relative; } .rmdsale:before { content: &quot;\\f07a&quot;; font-family: FontAwesome; left:10px; position:absolute; top:15px; bottom: 0px; font-size: 40px; } The text field for readers to enter their email address is created by code in email_submit.html, which inserts some elements from a google form into the page. To make this work, we have to create a new google form (using the ‘old google forms,’ not the current version), and copy over the key and HTML element details from the default form view. Chrome’s element inspector is very handy for identifying the element details that need to go in email_submit.html. The confirmation page that the reader sees after they submit their email is not yet elegant, it’s just the default google forms page. I’m not sure what to do about that. The email addresses collected by this block are visible in my google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Iyr_U-2AnrOVZBRVMhxihD8Ndpw_Pa2vdmCcFzKuPo/edit#gid=688456476 7.0.3 Google analytics This is already used in many bookdown projects, and is easy to enable. We go to https://analytics.google.com, create a new account, and get the code snippet and paste it into google_analytics.html. After that, we add a reference to google_analytics.html in _output.yml, as noted above. And that’s it for setting up the analytics. 7.0.4 Not yet implemented Matt’s ORT contains several other features that are not implemented here. These include tracking of hypothes.is use, A/B testing, a tool to translate the book into numerous languages. I’m not sure how to implement those, and would welcome assistance! 7.0.5 Issues It is important to keep style.css and the custom html files in the top level directory of the book. I tried putting them all in a directory together, but couldn’t get it to work. 7.0.6 Reuse The code for the Open Review Toolkit has an MIT license, and so is freely available for reuse.

"],["open.html", "Chapter 8 Open Review 8.1 FAQ about open review 8.2 Privacy and Consent Policy", " Chapter 8 Open Review Open Review means that you can freely read the book and easily help to make it better. You can offer suggestions by make annotations using hypothes.is, an open source annotation system. This is a very simple system for interacting with the book. If you are familiar with GitHub or Git, you can also comment using GitHub’s issue tracker for the book, or make a pull request. In addition to these feedback options, this website for the book will be collecting your implicit feedback by tracking the readership and abandonment rate of each section of the book. Open Review takes place before and at the same time as the book publisher’s peer review. The feedback from Open Review and peer review will be used to create a revised manuscript. The Open Review period will end when the final manuscript is submitted to the publisher. The concept of Open Review, as it is implemented here, is taken from Matthew Salganik’s Open Review Toolkit. Much of the text on this page comes from the Open Review Toolkit About page and the Open Review Toolkit Privacy and Consent page 8.1 FAQ about open review 8.1.1 What kind of feedback are you looking for? Open Review is not just about catching typos. Rather, Open Review is designed to collect all types of feedback, and I’d particularly welcome any feedback that you have about the substance of the book. Are there sections that you find particularly confusing? Are their points that you find particularly important? Am I making claims that you think need to be refined? Are there parts of the book that you think should be removed? When in doubt, I think you should follow one of the main principles at Wikipedia: Be bold. 8.1.2 Can I see the annotations that others are making? Yes, all the annotations are public. You can see them on right hand side of the each page or you can read them in stream form. 8.1.3 What are the benefits for readers? You get to read the manuscript and help make it better. 8.1.4 What are the benefits for authors and publishers? The Open Review process will benefit both authors and publishers, even if they have no interest in increasing access to knowledge. The process will lead to higher manuscript quality through the explicit and implicit feedback. Further, the Open Review process will provide valuable data that can be used during that marketing of the book. 8.1.5 Has anyone ever done something like this before? This is based on Matthew Salganik’s Open Review Toolkit. He’s written about some related efforts here: http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/open-review/ 8.1.6 What kind of information are you collecting and how will that information be used? Please read our privacy and consent policy, below. 8.1.7 How I can learn more about traditional peer review of academic books?
